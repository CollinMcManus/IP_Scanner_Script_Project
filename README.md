# IP_Scanner_Script_Project

This is a little project I did to be able to scan an IP and return information on it through a python script!

## Overview:
- The api resource used is ipinfo.io.
- This uses network lookups to automate a task with a python script.
- This is not for business use it uses a free version of an api resource and thus is only for educational use.
- It returns the coordinates, region, and city.


### Demonstrative output below:

python IP_Scanner.py

  Enter the IP address you would like to scan: 

  8.8.8.8

IP address that was scanned: 8.8.8.8

Location: 37.4056,-122.0775

City: Mountain View

Region: California
